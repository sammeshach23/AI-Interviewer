# AI-Interviewer
The AI Interviewer project leverages prompt engineering and Generative AI to create an intelligent interviewer that asks domain-specific questions, converts live audio to text using Google Gemini, evaluates responses for keyword relevance, and provides feedback with scores. It's built with Python and Streamlit, using Gemini for AI-driven interactions.
